# Federated-Learning-Medical-Diagnosis

This project implements a privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) system for binary medical classification (e.g., diabetes prediction). Using PyTorch and the Flower framework, it simulates multiple clients collaboratively training a shared neural network model on local data without transferring sensitive patient information.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

Traditional machine learning centralizes data, risking privacy violations. Federated Learning avoids this by training models locally on edge devices or institutions (e.g., hospitals), sharing only model updates with a central server.

This project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to train a binary classifier across simulated FL clients and compares the accuracy of federated vs. centralized training.
